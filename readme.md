For Heroku deployment:

Adding a Procfile

In order for us to successfully deploy any application to Heroku, we must add a Procfile to that application.

Before we can add a Procfile, we need to first install a web server called Gunicorn. Run the following command within the application folder.

pip install gunicorn

Update the requirements file by running

pip freeze > requirements.txt

Create a new file with Procfile as the name and do not add any extension. Add this line below

web: gunicorn app:app

web is used by Heroku to start a web server for the application. The app:app specifies the module and application name. In our application we have the app module and our flask application is also called app. If yourâ€™s are different you can change them.
